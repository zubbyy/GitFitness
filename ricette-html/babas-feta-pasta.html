</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<p>Make sure to prepare &amp; chop most ingredients before you
start.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Get a small deepish pan and heat it to low-medium temperature. Add a
good amount of virgin olive oil and place one of the small onion pieces
into the pan. Wait until it starts to sizzle and add the rest of the
onion. Mix well and make sure the temperature is not too high as it can
damage ingredients. Optional: You can sprinkle some sugar over the onion
to make it sweeter. Then after a few minutes, when the onion has
browned/softened, add in the garlic and wait 1-2 minutes, then you can
turn off heat and put it to the side for later.</li>
<li>Get a medium-large sized deepish pan, heat with oil and then add in
the olives, courgettes and mushrooms. Sprinkle salt every now and then
to enhance taste. After a few minutes when they are soft and are around
the same color, then add in the onion and garlic from the smaller
pan.</li>
<li>Wait a couple minutes and then add the broccoli and tomato slices to
the mix. Wait 2-3 more minutes and then get your rinsed feta and melt it
in the pan (chop to speed up).</li>
<li>Start <a href="pasta.html">cooking the pasta</a>.</li>
<li>When the feta has nearly finished melting, add in the stock to the
mix. Turn the pan temperature down slightly and then let it bubble for 5
mins (add a timer). Make sure to add the cover to the pan to keep in the
flavor.</li>
<li>After the 5 mins timer is up, add the overfilled tablespoon creme
cheese to the main mix, stir, then re-add lid.</li>
<li>Wait 2-3 more minutes and then you can test the sauce if you want.
If you feel there is some missing, add more mixed spice or herbs such as
parsley to it.</li>
<li>Turn down the main mix again slightly and add the 1/3 Mug of Whole
milk to the mix.</li>
<li>Strain and serve your pasta and cover with the sauce. Enjoy!</li>
