<h1 id="pozharskiye-cutlets">Pozharskiye Cutlets</h1>
<p>Famous Russian cutlet recipe, favoured by Nicholas I. Despite what
seems to be a massive amount of butter required, they’re rather light,
yet creamy.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chicken mince</li>
<li>Butter (originally, 1 part butter per 2 parts chicken; 1/4 works
perfectly fine)</li>
<li>Eggs (~1 egg per 500g chicken, plus 3-5 for the breading)</li>
<li>A couple white bread loaves (store-bought breadcrumbs also suffice,
but require more eggs)</li>
<li>Spices/salt (optional, recommended)</li>
<li>Non-lard based, non-chunky sauce (optional)</li>
<li>Onions (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Prepare 2 medium-sized and 1 extra large bowl, a few plates and a
regular frying pan.</li>
<li>Get the chicken out of the cold and into the XL bowl. Butter, too,
but onto a plate.</li>
<li>While they warm up, crumb up the bread. By hand. The smaller, the
better. If you’re using store-bought crumbs, just put those into a
bowl.</li>
<li>Mince the chicken, if necessary. Mince the onions, if you desire
them. Divide butter, once softened, into medium bits.</li>
<li>Add eggs to the meat and put a few into a medium bowl; mix both
bowls’ contents thoroughly.</li>
<li>Add the spices, salt and/or sauce of your choosing. Some may
consider this barbaric, but I found that Heinz’s mustard ketchup works
exceptionally well with the recipe. They’ll come out a tad red,
though.</li>
<li>Add the softened-up butter to the XL bowl and mix thoroughly.</li>
<li>MAKE A TEST CUTLET by rolling up a small ball of the mince, then
dipping it into the bread, then into the eggs, then into the bread
again, compounding the breading slightly between dips. More dips means
less leaked butter/juice, but don’t overdo it lest you want more bread
than meat in your cutlet.</li>
<li>Fry, let cool and then taste the cutlet. (Pozharskiye are very
juicy, so liquid in the pan is to be expected.)</li>
<li>If unsatisfied, add more flavoring or throw everything away. If
satisfied, repeat step 9. (Most cutlet sizes work well. Haven’t tried
making giant or tiny ones, though.)</li>
</ol>
