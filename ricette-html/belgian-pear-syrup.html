<h1 id="belgian-pear-syrup">Belgian pear syrup</h1>
<p>A delicious syrup that can be eaten on bread and used in a multitude
of recipes.</p>
<ul>
<li>‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 30 min</li>
<li>üç≥ Cook time: 6 hours</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>7 pears (Quality doesn‚Äôt matter; you can argue that overripe pears
are better because they have more sugar content.)</li>
<li>3 apples</li>
<li>a small handful of dates, raisins, dried apricots or prunes
(optional ‚Äì you can experiment with these; they can bring out some nice
flavors.)</li>
<li>150 grams sugar</li>
<li>1 glass of water</li>
<li>find sieve or cheese cloth</li>
<li>glass jar</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Wash the outside of the fruit with water and cut it in 8 medium
sized pieces. You don‚Äôt have to core or deseed the fruit; everything can
go in the pot.</li>
<li>Place the fruit in a large pan with a thick bottom so you get even
heat. I suggest you place the pears on the bottom, since they don‚Äôt burn
as fast. Add the glass of water.</li>
<li>If you are using them, add the dried fruits at this point.</li>
<li>Put the heat as low as possible and let it all slowly stew for 3
hours, stirring every now and then.</li>
<li>At this point, you can boil your glass jars to sterilize them. Place
the sterilized jars on a clean, dry towel.</li>
<li>When the fruit is done cooking for 3 hours, grab your sieve or
cheese cloth, and place it over a bowl, run your fruit through it until
you have extracted all the clear liquid. You can discard the pulp.</li>
<li>Quickly rinse the pot with water until clean and add the fruit
liquid back. Place back on the stove.</li>
<li>Add the sugar. Add a bit less sugar if you also used dried
fruits.</li>
<li>Cook for another 2 hours. After that, stir every so often, Be
careful with the stirring; if you stir too often, it might caramelize
too quickly.</li>
<li>After two to two and a half hours, your syrup should be nearly
done.</li>
<li>At this point, it‚Äôs up to you on how thick you want your syrup to
be. A good way to test the viscosity is to drop a little bit on a cold
plate or on your countertop to see how it is at room temperature.</li>
<li>When you are happy with the viscosity, pour the syrup into your
sterilized jars and immediately seal them.</li>
