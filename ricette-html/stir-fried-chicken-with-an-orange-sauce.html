<h1 id="stir-fried-chicken-with-an-orange-sauce">Stir Fried Chicken with
an Orange Sauce</h1>
<p>I could have called this Orange Chicken but I feel like some people
wouldn’t classify my recipe that way.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chicken (a pound or two)</li>
<li>Oranges</li>
<li>An Onion</li>
<li>Two Red Bell Peppers</li>
<li>Soy Sauce</li>
<li>Honey</li>
<li>Butter</li>
<li>Flour</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Chop your onion and red bell peppers into small bits and throw them
in a large frying pan to cook with a pat of butter, stirring
occasionally.</li>
<li>Chop your chicken into small bite sized pieces, add them to your pan
once your onions begin to become translucent. Stir occasionally.</li>
<li>If you have something to zest your oranges with add some zest to the
ingredients in your pan (if you don’t have a zesting thing don’t worry
about it).</li>
<li>While your chicken is cooking hand squeeze the juice out of your
oranges into a bowl, I will usually use the juice of five oranges but
three or four might be enough.</li>
<li>Once your chicken is cooked pour your freshly squeezed orange juice
into your pan, then pour in some soy sauce (you want your orange juice
to soy sauce ratio to be about 3:1, use your best judgment on how much
to pour in). Add honey (use as much as you want, I wouldn’t use less
than two tablespoons though) and stir. Turn the stove to
medium-high.</li>
<li>Let that sit for a few minutes to let the flavors get to know each
other a bit, then stir in a few spoonfuls of flour to thicken the
sauce.</li>
<li>Once the sauce has reached your preferred level of thickness take it
off the heat. Serve over rice.</li>
</ol>
