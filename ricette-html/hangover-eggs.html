<h1 id="hangover-eggs">Hangover Eggs</h1>
<p>Whenever my friends back home would drink to excess, they’d wake up
wanting something tasty. I made them what I call “Hangover Eggs”.
Whether or not you’re hungover, they’re very delicious! I’ve recently
been making them to gain weight, though you can alter the recipe to
whatever suits your lifestyle.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tony Chachere’s</li>
<li>Green onions</li>
<li>Olive oil</li>
<li>Loaf of French Bread</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Tabasco</li>
<li>Beer</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Bring a cast iron pan to medium-high heat and add a second or two of
olive oil when things start to warm up.</li>
<li>While the pan heats up, use your hands and tear off pieces of bread
that are roughly the size of your hand.</li>
<li>Make sure you have one piece of bread per egg you want to make. I’ve
dabbled with the egg:bread ratios, and this seems to work.</li>
<li>Once the olive oil starts smelling a bit (or smoke comes off of it),
crack in however many eggs you care to eat. Turn down the heat to
medium.</li>
<li>Act fast! As the eggs start cooking, prepare a plate with two
handfuls of chopped green onion and Tabasco.</li>
<li>After about four minutes (or when the tops of the eggs start to
set), take out eggs and place on top of bed of onions &amp;
Tabasco.</li>
<li>Turn heat back to medium-high and add a touch more olive oil. Place
pieces of bread in pan.</li>
<li>Every so often, move the pieces of bread around to soak up the
oil.</li>
<li>When the bread is about to turn a good shade of golden-brown, add a
generous sprinkle of Tony Chachere’s to the plated eggs (on top of
them).</li>
<li>Turn off the heat and move the pan off the burner. Take out bread
pieces and place on the same plate as the eggs.</li>
<li>Serve with glass of ice-cold beer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ideally, you won’t even need a fork! Simply use the bread to guide
the eggs on top of each piece, break the yolk into the piece, and take a
large bite.</p>
