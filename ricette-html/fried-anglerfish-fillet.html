<p>This is a simple light-flavoured recipe. Anglerfish (I’m referring
specifically to the ‘monfish/sea-devil’ variant) meat is mild, absorbing
the butter and subtle flavours of the herbs. Preparing the anglerfish is
an involved process that I’ll try and explain to the best of my
abilities but watching someone do it would be more then helpful.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 Anglerfish</li>
<li>Butter, enough to fry with</li>
<li>Chives or green onions</li>
<li>Marjoram, fresh herbs are preferable</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<h3 id="preparing-the-fish">Preparing the fish</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Turn the creature on its back. With a sharp and preferably
short-bladed knife make an incision from the anus to just between the
two small fins under the head. This is best done by inserting the knife
blade tip facing up while putting force upwards and moving towards the
head, letting gravity do the work. This helps to avoid puncturing the
organs.</li>
<li>Remove the organs. Gently pull and cut the membrane that connects
each to the rest of the body.</li>
<li>Make an incision around the mouth (the hard ‘lips’), turn the fish
around and do the same to that side.</li>
<li>Start to slowly but firmly pull back the skin cutting whenever there
is resistance as you make your way towards the tail.</li>
<li>Once you have removed the skin, flip it back onto its back and cut
off the thin flabs of meat of its underside and fins from the body. At
this point there should be a clear distinction between the body and the
larger head. Behead the animal.</li>
<li>With a filleting knife, fillet the meat from the backbone and remove
the tail.</li>
<li>You should be left with 2 long strips of meat. Cut each in
half.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="cooking">Cooking</h3>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>In a pan on medium heat, melt a good amount of butter and place the
fillets inside. The goal here is to sear the meat to get that light
crust. Flip until all sides have turned the ‘golden brown’ color.</li>
<li>Add the herbs, just enough to cover the fillets, salt and pepper too
if desired and cover with the lid on low heat until fully cooked. Time
here varies but it can be anywhere between 5-10 minutes.</li>
<li>Enjoy. This goes well with steamed vegetables. Or potatoes to soak
up the butter.</li>
</ol>
