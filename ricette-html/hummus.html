<h1 id="hummus">Hummus</h1>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>One can of garbanzo beans (chickpeas)</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1/2 cup of tahini (also known as tehina)</li>
<li>1/4 cup (or more, to taste) of lemon juice, fresh preferred - this
is about 1 1/2 to 2 lemons’ worth</li>
<li>1 (or 2) clove(s) of garlic, roughly chopped (fresh or frozen
pre-chopped is fine, but not dry)</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon cumin, ground (if you have whole, toast in a dry pan
until fragrant before grinding)</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon za’atar (optional, if you can find it)</li>
<li>1 Tablespoon of olive oil, plus more for serving</li>
<li>Fresh parsley (optional for serving)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Drain and rinse the garbanzo beans.</li>
<li>Place garbanzo beans in a small saucepan or pot, add 1 teaspoon
baking soda (this alters the pH to encourage the beans to break down and
shed their skins), and cover with a few inches of water. Bring to a boil
and cook for 20 minutes, until the skins begin to fall off and the beans
look overcooked/mushy. You may need to reduce the heat after a few
minutes to prevent boil-overs.</li>
<li>While the garbanzo beans are boiling, combine the garlic and lemon
juice with 1/4 teaspoon salt in the workbowl of your food processor.
Pulse until a fine, uniform consistency is achieved. You may need to
scrape down the top and sides of the bowl to ensure the garlic is
chopped finely enough. Leave the mixture for at least 10 minutes for the
raw garlic taste to mellow.</li>
<li>After 20 minutes of boiling, drain the garbanzo beans and their
skins in a mesh strainer, then rinse for at least 30 seconds with cold
water to remove any lingering taste from the baking soda.</li>
<li>Add the tahini to the food processor. Blend until creamy. Scrape
down the sides and bottom of the bowl.</li>
<li>While the food processor is running on “high,” slowly drizzle in two
tablespoons of ice-cold water. Continue to run on high, scraping down
the bowl as necessary (1-3 times), until the mixture has enough air
worked into it that it lightens in color and thickens in texture
substantially.</li>
<li>Scrape down the bowl again, then add the garbanzo beans and cumin
(and za’atar, if you have it). Pulse a few times, then set the food
processor to high again. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon of olive oil, as slowly
as you can manage.</li>
<li>Continue to process the hummus on high for at least one minute
longer, up to three minutes longer if it hasn’t become smooth enough
yet. You can make the hummus thinner at this point by slowly adding ice
water a teaspoon at a time while processing on high. Taste the hummus at
this point to determine if it needs more lemon juice or more salt for
flavor.</li>
<li>Transfer the hummus into a serving bowl and smooth out the surface
with the back of a spoon, creating swirls or indentations for olive oil
as desired. Top with additional olive oil and optionally finely chopped
fresh parsley, more za’atar, or a sprinkling of sumac (a spice mixture)
or dukkah (a seed mixture).</li>
<li>Serve immediately or transfer to an airtight container and store in
the refrigerator for up to one week.</li>
