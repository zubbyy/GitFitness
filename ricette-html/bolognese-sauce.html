</ul>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>2 carrots</li>
<li>2 celery sticks</li>
<li>1 large onion</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves (optional, but not traditional)</li>
<li>200 grams pancetta (optional)</li>
<li>300 grams beef mince</li>
<li>350 grams pork mince</li>
<li>350 grams veal mince (if you cant find veal replace with pork)</li>
<li>140 grams concentrated tomato paste</li>
<li>690 grams diced tomatoes</li>
<li>water</li>
<li>1 can peeled tomatoes</li>
<li>1-2 glasses wine (whatever you have open)</li>
<li>1 glass of milk (optional)</li>
<li>1 glass of beef/vegetable stock (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Finely dice the carrots, celery, onion and pancetta, if your blender
can handle it you can optionally blend all this to speed it up.</li>
<li>Heat up a large saucepan or dutch oven on medium low heat and put
enough olive oil in to cover the bottom of the pan.</li>
<li>Put in your diced veggies and pancetta and let it slowly saut√© for
about 10 minutes until everything is fragrant and soft.</li>
<li>If you are using garlic add it here and let it sweat for a
minute</li>
<li>Add in your minced meat and break it up into small clumps about the
size of a rice grain with a spoon, keep stiring until all your meat is
lightly cooked.</li>
<li>Once all your meat is cooked and looks a bit grey add your wine, add
enough to fully deglaze the pan (I usually add a little bit extra for
the flavor) stir it through until it has completely evaporated. (If you
are using it you can also add the stock at this point)</li>
<li>Once your pan is somewhat dry you can add the tomato paste to the
beef, let it cook for a minute to remove the slight metallic taste.</li>
<li>Add your canned and peeled tomatoes and use your spoon to break them
up, you don‚Äôt have to be too thorough since they will soften up while
the sauce cooks.</li>
<li>add the diced tomatoes, fill the jar your tomatoes came in with
water give it a shake and add that to the pot, do the same with your can
of peeled tomatoes.</li>
<li>lower your heat to the lowest setting and slightly cover the pan
with your lid.</li>
<li>let it simmer for as long as you can wait, preferably at least 4
hours, if it starts getting a bit too dry you can add a bit more water
to make sure the sauce doesn‚Äôt burn.</li>
<li>Once it‚Äôs done simmering for as long as you can muster and its nice
and thick, the liquid should not come above your meat and should be
pretty concentrated</li>
<li>You can add your glass of milk, let it simmer for 10 more minutes
and serve.</li>
</ol>
