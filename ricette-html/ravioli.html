<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>The basic rule of thumb I use for pasta is 100g, 1 egg per
person</li>
<li>For this recipe you can go two ways, the old school ‚Äúwell‚Äù method or
a kitchen aid mixer (skip to step 7)</li>
<li>For the well method, pile the flour onto the counter and with your
hand carve a hole or a well in the center</li>
<li>Crack the eggs into the center of the well, and drizzle a bit of
olive oil into the center</li>
<li>With a fork, begin slowly breaking up, mixing, and incorporating the
egg into the flour until there is no longer any loose egg that can
escape the outer well border</li>
<li>At this point use your hands to bring the sandy mixture together and
knead the dough for about 5-10 minutes or until the dough is smooth</li>
<li>For the stand mixer method just throw all the ingredients into the
mixer with a dough hook and set it to level 4 for about 3-5 minutes and
it will be done</li>
<li>You might need to scrape the sides down and maybe hand knead the
dough a bit longer after it‚Äôs done to make it into a nice smooth
ball</li>
<li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge a
bit so it‚Äôs easier to roll out (15-30 mins)</li>
<li>While the dough is resting, make the filling by first mixing the
ricotta and egg into a bowl</li>
<li>Zest and juice a lemon peel into the bowl</li>
<li>Optionally add seafood ingredients at this point</li>
<li>Grate the Pecorino into the bowl, add salt and pepper to taste, and
mix to distribute the ingredients evenly</li>
<li>Take out the dough and cut it into 4 pieces, keeping the ones not
currently being worked on covered so they don‚Äôt dry out</li>
<li>Roll the dough out with a pasta machine down to the point where you
can just barely see your hand through it (setting 2-3 out of 7) or roll
it out with a rolling pin into a long sheet, maybe like 16 x 8 inches or
so</li>
<li>At this point you can either cut the sheet in half and make two
sheets, a top and bottom, or one sheet, where you will fold the dough
over and use the folded seam as one side of the ravioli <img

<li>Using a teaspoon, evenly space out the ricotta filling onto the
sheets, leaving a few inches on each side for the seams</li>
<li>As stated in step 16, either take the 2nd sheet and place it over
top or fold over the dough and press down firmly, forcing out any air
and making sure the two pieces of dough stick</li>
<li>You may need to brush some water onto the dough if it is too heavily
floured and not sticking</li>
<li>Using a fancy pasta cutter, a knife, or even a pizza cutter, cut
evenly between the seams of the raviolis to separate them</li>
<li>If you used a pasta cutter, you are now done, store the raviolis on
a floured wax paper sheet or freeze them for later <img
src="pix/ravioli-03.webp" alt="Finished Ravioli" /></li>
<li>If you don‚Äôt have a pasta cutter, use a fork to press down the dough
around the edges of the cut raviolis to ensure they are firmly closed
and no leaks or air bubbles are visible, or else they will explode when
cooked</li>
<li>To cook, throw them in salted boiling water and they will let you
know when they‚Äôre done when they float to the top (1-2 minutes)</li>
<li>Serve the seafood version with a simple fresh red sauce and basil,
or spice it up a bit and go with a base of red sauce with some added
heavy cream, and a pinch of red pepper flakes to make a pink sauce for
the seafood version <img src="pix/ravioli-04.webp"
