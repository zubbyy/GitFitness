<h1>This is the dish title</h1>
<p>If necessary, provide a very brief description of the dish in one or two sentences.
For most dishes, this will be unnecessary.
If there is a title image of this dish, it should be above this paragraph.
You may also include prep/cook time and the number of servings as below:</p>
<ul>
<li>‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 10 min</li>
<li>üç≥ Cook time: 30 min</li>
<li>üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 4</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>There must be a blank line above all lists.</li>
<li>List the ingredients</li>
<li>in an unordered list</li>
<li>similar to this.</li>
<li>List amounts if necessary.</li>
<li>Put (optional) at the end of optional ingredients</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Now using an ordered list,</li>
<li>give the directions to prepare the dish.</li>
<li>Do <strong>not</strong> add unnecessary blank lines between items.</li>
<li>If necessary,</li>
<li>an image can be included between some directions if needed to explain something particular.</li>
<li>But that should be kept to a minimum to reduce bandwidth and aid in simplicity.</li>
</ol>
